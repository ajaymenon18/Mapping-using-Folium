It is a code that maps given coordinates, two feature groups are created one specifying the volcanoes which are colorcoded on the basis of the height
Another group takes the population data from the world.json file and arranges the countries in the map into different color coded regions on the basis of the population
Layout is made to toggle between the two feature groups
