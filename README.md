It is a code that maps given coordinates, two feature groups are created one specifying the volcanoes which are colorcoded on the basis of the height
Another group takes the population data from the world.json file and arranges the countries in the map into different color coded regions on the basis of the population
Layout is made to toggle between the two feature groups

If elevation of the volcano is less than 1000 then it is identified by the green color, If it is between
1000 and 3000 then it is identified by orange and if the elevation is greater than 3000m then it is identified by red
